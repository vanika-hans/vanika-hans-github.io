					<h1>ELP Mentors </h1>
					<p> Over the course of my ELP career, I've been fortunate enough to get to know Sai Radhakrishnan. 
					After pursuing a degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering at CU Boulder, Sai went on to pursue
					Med School. She is currently in her third year of Med School in Houston, Texas. She is originally from Colorado.
					Talking with Sai has been an extremely enlightening experience for me, as she is truly full of so many stories
					and experiences to share. Her passion for mentoring and self-exploration is truly inspring, and it's truly
					been wonderful being her mentee. Below are some documentations of our email exchanges; we had gotten outo
					of touch for some period of time, but were able to regain communication.</p>
					<a name="log"></a>
					<h2>Activity Log </h2>
					
					<p> <bold>11/13/16: First Email Exchange (Vanika)</bold> <br> Hi Saikripa, <br> <br> My 
					name is Vanika Hans, and I am currently a Junior at CU Boulder, as well as a member 
					of the ELP program. It has been quite a while, but I believe you were assigned as my 
					mentor for the YAM program, and I was hoping to reach out to you and see if you are 
					still interested. I have many questions and would love to get to know you! <br> 
					Please let me know if you are interested, and then perhaps we can figure out a means of communication (coffee, skype, etc).
					<br>Thank you! Look forward to hearing back.</p>
					
					<p><bold>11/18/16: First time I Heard Back (Sai)</bold> <br> Hi Vanika! It's great to hear from you. I would love to be your mentor and answer your questions. 
					What are some days that are good for you? We can either meet in person or on Skype depending on the day.<br>
					How's school going so far? Are you enjoying your major and CU? We can talk more about this when we talk! <br>
					Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
					
					<p><bold> 01/29/17(Vanika)</bold>Hope you've been well! I wanted to reach out to you and see how you are doing! I think we need to find a better means of communication instead
					of over email, as I am very prone to reading emails and never looking back again, haha! <br> That being said, it would be great if you could send me a text at 7192293381 whenever you get a chance. <br>
					School is going well! Junior year is...well, Junior Year. I'm taking some pretty great classes, though, and I'm very much looking forward to what Spring Semester will entail! How about you? What are 
					you up to these days? You've graduated from CU, right?</p> 
					
					<p><bold> 02/22/17: (Vanika)</bold> How is everything going? I heard from Ang that you are currently pursuing Med School, which is totally AWESOME.
					Are you attending CU's school, or did you branch off to another organization? I had a few questions to ask you, mainly to get to know you 
					since we haven't had quite yet had the chance to have a discussion. (Also, since it has been a while since we've talked, please let me know
					if you're still able to be a YAM mentor! I'd appreciate any time you have to give. :) ) <br> 
					1. Were there any activities or communities on campus that you especially admired or enjoyed when you were a student? <br>
					2. What were the most rewarding things you did as a college student, outside of the classroom? What made these so rewarding? <br>
					3. Do you see any needs in the community that might be opportunities for someone like me to make a difference? <br>
					4. When you were a student on campus, did you take on any leadership roles or make a difference in ways that make you proud? <br>
					5. Do you have any suggestions for how I can do an especially effective job brainstorming? <br>
					If you have any other notes to add on, I'd love to hear it. Thanks so much, and have a great rest of your day! <br></p>
				
					<p>***After a long hiatus during which it was found that Sai changed her email***</p>
					
					<p> <bold>09/29/17 (Vanika)</bold> I hope you've been well! Looks like Ang reached out to you last April, and I was able to get your updated 
					email address. I'm so glad I'll be able to hopefully connect with an actual Sai now, haha! <br> How are you? Where are you now, after graduation? 
					Are you pursuing a Master's degree, or are you working? <br> I'm currently in my Senior Year  as an Electrical Engineer, starting off the Controls 
					Track, and doing a Capstone project (we're making a Smart Cane!) This summer, I did a pretty cool internship at Intel up in Fort Collins, and will 
					be going to the bigger office in Hillsboro for a full-time after graduation! I'm very excited about it, but also a little nervous as I've been in 
					Colorado my whole life, and I'm not totally ready to move away from my family. <br>I'm currently taking COEN 3052, which is basically a Leadership 
					Class geared towards organizing a Leadership Experience! What did you do for your Leadership Experience? <br> I'd love to set up a Skype Call so we 
					can actually communicate! Haha. Let me know what your availability in the next few weeks will be. Looking forward to hearing back. :) </p>
					
					<p> <bold> 9/29/17 (Sai)</bold> Yeah! I'm so glad you got the right email. Congrats on becoming a senior! That's a really big deal :) <br> 
					I am in medical school right now here in Colorado. It's not exactly engineering, but I am loving everything that I am learning. I actually worked in 
					Houston doing an engineering job for a year after graduation, so if you are nervous about moving out and want to hear about my experience, I would love
					to share it. <br> That Capstone project seems awesome! Is a Smart Cane for medical purposes? Regardless, good luck. The Capstone is exactly that; it is a 
					reflection on everything you learned in the past 3 years, and it is really fun. <br> I am not familiar with that class, unfortunately! I don't know if that 
					program was around when I was in college. But, if there is anything I can do to help you, definitely let me know! <br> I would also love to Skype or talk 
					on the phone or anything really! Let me know what times you are free!</p>
					
					<p> <bold> 10/29/17 (Vanika)</bold> Thank you!!! <br> That is really cool! Where did you work? And what inspired you to apply to medical school? Also, where 
					do you go now - do you attend Anshutz? Also, that would be amazing if you could share your experience. What was going through your mind as you were finishing 
					up your degree knowing you were headed to Houston? What were some challenges you encountered after making the move? Were these challenges an accurate representation
					of the reality you experienced there? <br>  Thank you! Yes, it is kind of, I guess! It's more geared towards advancing the basic blind cane. But we hope that our sponsor 
					will adapt our prototype and implement this to those that may benefit in Dubai. What project did you do? I think I vaguely recall something about a rickshaw project...was 
					that you? I remember that it was mentioned at an ELP Seminar way back! <br> Sure, sounds great! Sorry about the spread apart emails, by the way. I have this awful 
					habit of reading emails immediately and not responding, which then I remember like wayyyy later. But, perhaps either of those mediums (Skype or phone call) might be better. :)
					Will you have any time next Monday for a conversation? <br> Also: I had a few other questions for you if you have a chance to respond (so so many questions in this email! 
					We can also address these during our Skype call. haha!) <br> 1) My Leadership Experience is going to be to organize a Networking Event for SWE. I organized the Networking Night
					event this last month, which had about 78 student attendees as well as about 25 industry representatives involved. It was an incredible experience, but I'm using 
					that as a precursor/practice run for the real deal this upcoming Spring. Do you have any experience in organizing large-scale events like this? If so, do you have any advice? <br>
					2) My particular goals for the ELP portfolio are to successfully integrate STEM and a better understanding of Industry to current CU Students (more specifically to SWE since I am 
					the VP), as well as to have a good capstone group experience. Are these something you think are specific enough/too ambitious/not ambitious enough? <br> Thank you so much for all 
					of your future help. I am very much looking forward to our mentoring relationship - I hope that I can also help provide some reflection on your experiences a few years ago as we 
					continue to discuss things you experienced in the past. <br> </p>	
					
					<p> <bold> 11/2/17 (Sai)</bold> Hey Vanika! <br> This is perfect, how about we talk on Monday night (7-8pm)? Does that work for you? <br> And then, I can answer
					these questions, cause I hate typing; but these are excellent questions and I want to make sure that I answer them! </p>
					
					<p> <bold> 02/10/18 (Vanika) </bold> Hi Sai, Hope you've been well. I do want to apologize that I'm awful at replying to your emails, honestly every time I reach out to you, I am
					fully confident that we'll set up a time to talk, and then life gets crazy and my mind goes everywhere - leaving your email read but not replied to! This is something I'm 
					really trying to work on this semester, I have lots of things I want to accomplish but a really unorganized way of doing it! <br> Anyways, I am reaching out to you in hopes of 
					setting up a Skype call sometime this or next week. Let me know your availability this week/next week, and hopefully we can finally set something up.<br> </p>
				
					<p> <bold> 02/12/18 (Sai) </bold> I'm free on Wednesday and Friday after 7 pm. Otherwise, if there are other times that you prefer, let me know! </p>
					
					<p> *** More coordination *** </p>
					
					<p> <bold> 02/17/18 - Skype Call </bold> In this call, after an extremely convoluted time spent talking over email, the following is a list of things that we were able to talk about: <br>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Received some advice on stress management. Sai suggested that next time I'm stressed, that I can try making a list of my morals/values in that moment. She also suggested I can make a list of what I can do about the situation, and then choosing what's easiest to accomplish.</li>
						<li>Briefly discussed a situation with my Capstone Group that involved a new experience for me. Sai mentioned here that I acted in a graceful manner, and gave an example of how I could have unprofessionally acted. It was great to get some perspective on this from someone that is not currently in Capstone! </li>
						<li>Talked about Oregon and big life changes for me on the way. Sai talked about how it took her like a few weeks to get adjusted, but everyone had really low expectations for her when she first started working, so it was a good way to adjust. 
						She also mentioned that living alone at her apartment when she first moved was a little bit lonely sometimes, but that she'd be happy to 
						share her experience with it.</li>
						<li>Brought up the Retreat that I need to complete for COEN 3050. Sai provided some great ideas for this! She recommended
making it like a picnic for herself, like basically to have it as a day of self-reflection, and watching TED talks. </li>
						<li>Got to actually know her better! Sai mentioned that it is her third year of med school, where the first two were extremely textbook-like, and all of a sudden a lot changed! We had some discussion here
						of her experience in the medical world, and I really got to understand her perspective. She seems like a very reflective student.		</li>
						<li>Made plans to chat in the future! We plan to talk once a month, including after graduation. We also exchanged numbers, as to not just rely on emailing each other with very slow replies.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Empowering Advice </h2>
					<p>So far, the biggest piece of advice I've gotten from Sai is the methods by which I can deal with stress, as well as her suggestions based on her experiences living alone in a brand new city. For instance,
					she suggested a logical approach to stressful situations, and after experiences a few of these after interacting with her, I really found it useful to break down stressful situations and divide and conquer the easiest first. 
					As for living alone, she gave some tips how to survive doing this, such as things like always having background music going around in the background.</p>

					<h1>ELP Seminar Speakers</h1>
					<h2> Jamais Cascio • Conference on World Affairs Speaker • April 6, 2016</h2>
					<p> Jamais Cascio is a professional futurist: NOT a predictor, as he may add. Cascio is an extremely unique individual, in the sense that not only is his career something I hadn't heard of prior to, but it involves a
					skillset that most, if not all of us, should develop to some extent. Cascio's occupation involves predicting and considering different possibilities that humankind could be faced with, in addition to laying out possible 
					solutions. Interestingly, these "possibilities" refer to future conflicts, which aren't limited to physical possibilities, but also to common ethical practices.</p>
					<p> The one that stuck out to me in particular was the discussion involving brain uploading. It wasn't so much this topic that got me, but after Cascio discussed the several points of views on this topic, I realized that there really is no direct answer to these ethical problems. There are thousands of possibilities for where humankind can go, especially with the level of intelligence that we have achieved in our current century. Not only is it then terrifying, but also extremely pressuring, that each and every decision we make affects our future generations. </p>
					<p> To write this reflection, I purposefully waited as long as possible to see truly what the long-term outcomes were from this discussion. What I have determined is that Cascio's discussion really made me aware of who I am as an individual, where with the evolving world there becomes more and more ethical responsibility. However, with this responsibility comes the opportunity to further educate myself about each and every problem, in addition to hearing and taking into account other people's views on these opinions.</p>
					<p> The "skills" I referred to earlier are exactly what Cascio's discussion instilled I should learn. The skills break down into the following. First, we all need to develop this aptitude to even question these difficult questions. MANY of the individuals I know tend to run away from issues in their lives, and avoiding these moral issues are going to be extremely harmful to our future. Secondly, we must develop the skillset to truly question everything: why do we think the way we do about everything? How can we change that? And, finally: we must develop the confidence and skillset to handle these issues, as well as the capacity to hear contradicting perspectives.</p>
					<p> My takeway from this seminar had very less to do with what Cascio was discussing, but more so the holistic implications of the things he was discussing. Cascio's discussion really opened my eyes to where I am in my engineering degree, where all of the world I will be doing in just a couple years will actually be affecting so much more.</p>
					<h2> Danielle Feinberg • Pixar Animation Studios • November 1, 2017</h2>
					<p> Danielle Feinberg, a Boulder High School Alumni, presented on the intertwining of science and coding while working at Pixar Studios. Danielle specializes in lighting, which means that not only does her job title require an in-depth knowledge of physics, but also the capability to bring these concepts to life through programming and the creativity to make these features visually pleasing and effective in showing the audience a story. Danielle made it very clear in her presentation that her job in lighting isn't to recreate the world that we see, but to create a world that we can believe. </p>
					<p> Danielle's discussion was very inspiring in many ways. What stood out most to me most was that her passion in life is so specific - lighting in animation. As a college student taking classes of many, many different topics, finding a specific niche of where I belong as an engineer is definitely a challenge. In Danielle's experience, although it may seem like a random specialty, she was only able to find her love for lighting in Disney movies by going out and learning about it. I aspire to be a leader in my life and go out to seek a passion that combines my interests altogether in a single job, just like Danielle who is using her love for art, computers, and science every single day. </p>
